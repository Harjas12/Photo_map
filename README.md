# Lab 6 - *Photo Map*

**Photo Map** is an app that allows the user to search for locations using the [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs) and create a pin with an image annotation.

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** user stories are complete:

- [x] Configure initial map view (+2pt)
- [x] User can take a photo (+1pt)
- [x] User can tag a location (+1pt)
- [x] User can drop a pin with image annotation (+1pt)

The following **stretch** user stories are implemented:

- [x] Implement a Custom MKAnnotation (+1pt)
- [ ] User can see Fullscreen Picture (+1pt)
- [ ] Replace the Pin with an Image (+1pt)
- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality! (+1-3pts)

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Button for talking images is rounded

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. How to gain better control over accessing the pins.
2. How to create more complex protocols.

## Notes

The biggest challenge was understanding how to build my own protocol and delegate.
